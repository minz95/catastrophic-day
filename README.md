# Catastrophic Day

A competitive multiplayer racing game for Roblox (up to 10 players) built with Luau and Rojo.
Each round cycles through three phases: Farming, Crafting, and Racing.

---

## Game Loop

1. **Farming** (90 seconds) -- Collect items scattered across the biome map.
   Items have four rarity tiers (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic) with distinct visual effects.
   Players can contest item pickups or attempt to steal from each other's inventory.

2. **Crafting** (120 seconds) -- Assign collected items to six vehicle slots:
   BODY, ENGINE, SPECIAL, MOBILITY (biome-specific), HEAD, and TAIL.
   Stats are computed server-side based on slot assignments, item rarity, and biome affinity.

3. **Racing** -- Drive the assembled vehicle to the finish line.
   Each biome has unique physics: mud drag (Forest), buoyancy (Ocean), or updraft zones (Sky).
   Boost pads, obstacles, and drift corners add moment-to-moment decisions.

## Development Setup

### Requirements
- [Rojo 7.6.1](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases) (file sync to Studio)
- Roblox Studio
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (for issue/PR workflow)

### Sync to Studio

1. Start the Rojo server:
   ```
   rojo serve roblox
   ```
2. In Roblox Studio, open the Rojo plugin panel and click **Connect**.
3. All Lua source files under `roblox/` sync live to the corresponding Studio locations.

### Solo Testing

`Constants.SOLO_TEST_MODE = true` (default) starts the game 2 seconds after one player connects,
skipping the lobby wait. Set to `false` before production deployment.

## Rarity System

| Tier | Spawn share | Stat multiplier | Visual |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Common | 60% | 1.0x | Plain white |
| Uncommon | 25% | 1.3x | Green glow ring |
| Rare | 12% | 1.6x | Blue glow + particles |
| Epic | 3% | 2.0x | Purple glow + particles + 3 orbiting orbs |

Epic items also gain 1.3x ability duration, 1.2x ability radius, and 0.8x cooldown.

---

## Sound

All audio asset IDs are stored in `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/SoundConfig.lua`.
Replace the placeholder IDs with real Roblox free audio IDs from the Toolbox before publishing.
The `SoundClient` handles BGM fading between phases and SFX routing for all game events.
